# Compound Interest Calculator

This project is a compound interest calculator created to display interest earnings from long term investments. I was fortunate enough to have a supply teacher in school show me the power of compound interest and have explained to many people the benefits of regular monthly savings. Now, I have a dedicated website to point people towards.
